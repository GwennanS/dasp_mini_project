# DASP_mini_project

# Assignment

During the course a mini project is conducted. In this project, algorithms for speech enhancement are designed, implemented (in Matlab), evaluated, and documented. The project work is carried out in groups of 2 students which are formed in the beginning of the course. It is expected that some project work must be carried out either at home or at the university. The physical outcome of the project is a technical report motivating the algorithm design and describing the implementation and evaluation of the algorithms. As this technical report will be discussed during the evaluation, participation in the mini project is compulsory in order to qualify for the course exam.

The final report (per group of 2 students) must be uploaded (individually) before June 18th 2021 via Brightspace. To do so, go to the course page in Brightspace, select the tab "assignments".

Project details:
- Design and build a single-channel speech enhancement (noise reduction) system for far-end noise reduction.
- Use matlab
- The speech enhancement system should consist of a gain function, noise PSD estimator and speech PSD estimator.
- Perform an evaluation of the speech enhancement system.

Optional:
- Implement a multi-microphone system
